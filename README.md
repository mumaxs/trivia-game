# Trivia-game

## Assignment

For this assignment, a single page application containing a trivia game was to be built through Vue.JS framework, and later deployed using Heroku. The purpose for this task was to utilize Javascript skills, using the Vue.JS framework. The trivia game involves fetching a number of questions from an API with different categories, question difficulty and game type. The user for this Vue application must be able to enter desired questions, answer them and later see the current result from the questions. 

## Project structure

The project structure involves three different components in StartScreen, which is the first interaction on the application; QuestionScreen, which represent the questions, which is displayed one at the time; ResultScreen, which is the final view for the user where the result is presented with the questions and correct answers. The total ammount of points is also displayed on the ResultScreen. Through the StartScreen component the API calls are used.
